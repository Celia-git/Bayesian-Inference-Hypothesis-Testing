# Bayesian Inference and Hypothesis Testing

This is an assignment for a Data Mining and Machine Learning class which explores fundamental concepts in statistical inference using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

**Topics Covered:**

* **Bayesian Inference:** Understanding and applying Bayes' theorem to update beliefs based on observed data.
* **Probability Density Function (PDF) Estimation:** Utilizing kernel density estimation (KDE) to estimate the underlying probability distribution of data.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating null and alternative hypotheses and using statistical methods to determine the evidence against the null hypothesis.
* **Bias in Estimation:** Identifying and understanding potential sources of bias in statistical estimators.
* **P-value Calculation using KDE:** Computing the p-value for a hypothesis test by obtaining the t-statistic through kernel density estimation.
* **Empirical Probability via Difference of Means:** Estimating probabilities empirically by comparing the means of different groups within the dataset.
* **Data Visualization:** Employing Matplotlib to visualize PDFs, KDE plots, and other relevant distributions to aid in understanding the data and results.
* **Data Manipulation:** Using NumPy and pandas for efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
